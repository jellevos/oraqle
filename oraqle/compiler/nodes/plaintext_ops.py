# TODO: Create PlainFunction that performs any named Python (?) code on Revealed inputs. We can maybe create a Plain class to flag revealed values.
# We should then also overload the operators on Plain to reflect that (which create functions).
# When we finally generate code, we can let people implement those named functions themselves.
